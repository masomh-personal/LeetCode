/**
 * Approach: Iterative Backtracking with Ordered Subset Extension
 *
 * This approach builds subsets iteratively while ensuring that duplicate numbers
 * do not create duplicate subsets. It does this by extending only the newly added
 * subsets when processing duplicate numbers.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n) - Each number is either included or excluded, generating 2^n subsets.
 * Sorting takes O(n log n), but subset generation dominates.
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(2^n) - Storing all subsets.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array that may contain duplicates.
 * @return {number[][]} - A list of all unique subsets.

     *   that duplicates are only added in the same "level" where they first appeared.
     * - Otherwise, extend from all subsets in `result` (including previous numbers).
